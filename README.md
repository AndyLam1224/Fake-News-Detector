# Fake-News-Detector
This Fake News Detector is a machine learning model using LSTM to classify real or fake news based on Tweets. 

Dataset
The data was curated via a variety of reliable sources. The real news sets were collected using the Twitter API to retrieve tweets from The New York Times, CNN, The Economist, National Public Radio, and Breaking News twitter accounts. The fake datasets were collected from the Kaggle datset 'Getting Real with Fake News' a collection of over 12,000 labeled fake news articles. To make the data more akin to tweets, only the titles of the articles were used.
